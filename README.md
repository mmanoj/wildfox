# WildFox
Adaptive QoS and DPI platform based on mathematical models &amp; Bioinformatics Algorithms

This is authors personal research work to bring mathematical models and bioinformatics to Telecom Policy Control and QoS/Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) domain.
This is experimental project based on currently available open source tools and research methods. As per the complexity of telecom grade policy control and QOS/DPI domain due to current complex demands and rapid technology changes, we required to think new approaches and optimized methodologies to develop adaptive framework using mathematics and evolutionary algorithms.

Project WildFox try to fill this industry gap with open source approach. This will help researches to share ideas and develop this filed in to next level.

Hope this helpful to industry and R&D teams.
