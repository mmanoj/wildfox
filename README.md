Adaptive QoS and DPI platform based on mathematical models &amp; Bioinformatics Algorithms

This is authors personal research work to bring matamatical models and bioinformatics to Telecom
Policy Control and QoS/Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) domain.

This is experimental project based on currently avilable open source tools and researh methods. As per the complexity of telecom grade
policy control and QOS/DPI domain due to current complex demands and rapid technology changes, we required to think new approaches and
optimized methodologies to develp adaptive framework using matamatics and evolutionary algorithms.

Project WildFox try to fill this industry gap with open source approach. This will help researches to share ideas and develop the filed in to
next level.

Hope this helpful to industry and R&D teams.
